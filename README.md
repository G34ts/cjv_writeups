# Writeup(S)

This is an open-source repository for writeups of all the CTFs we've done together as a team. from CTF competitions, multi-platform exercises, and mini-challenges.
The team: 
- Joshua Abraham (Lincoln)
- Carlson King ("well he said he had a dream, so why not?")
- Vaustin(they same the name means luck but this guy is having a tough luck)
