## Overview
Point    = 50 <br/>
Category = Forensic

## Descriptions
Players receive a text file with seeming random numbers. They need to take clues from the title and the challenge description in order to convert these numbers to a QR code which contains the flag.

### Solution
1. The first step I took was to download ```qr.code.txt.``` After the download was complete, I changed the directory from the folder in the terminal to the folder containing ```qr.code.txt```
