## Descriptions
We received this file of seemingly random numbers, but the person that sent it is adamant that it is a QR code. Can you figure it out for us?

### Solution
1. The first step I took was to download ```qr.code.txt.``` After the download was complete, I changed the directory from the folder in the terminal to the folder containing ```qr.code.txt``` <br/> <br/>
```Locate File``` <br/>

```Directory Changes``` <br/>

2. The second step I did was to try to open the downloaded file, and see what it contained. <br/> <br/>
```Opening File``` <br/>
```./[file]``` <br/>
![image](https://github.com/G34ts/cjv_writeups/assets/126637263/174d578c-ce60-4672-a9b2-ac0280eb12eb) <br/> <br/>
We can see, that in the ```qr.code.txt``` file, there are 29 lines of text, each of which contains a set of numbers that are randomized in order along with the amount. From what we know, the creator of the challenge mentions that these numbers are a **QR Code**. <br/> <br/>

3. Then for the third step, we can analyze how we can turn this set of numbers into a QR Code that can be scanned. The first thing I did was look at the title of this challenge. That is 1black0white. <br/> <br/>
If we associate that title with QR Codes is. The most dominant colors on an average QR Code are black and white. That was the first thing I thought of. Next is the number 1 in black and 0 in white. What we can associate for these 2 numbers for me are binary numbers. This made me have an idea, which is what if we convert each of these 29 numbers into binary numbers first, then use an online tool/python code to convert the binary numbers into an image. Which if the system detects there is a number 1, it will produce 1 black pixel, and vice versa. If the system detects a 0, it will produce 1 white pixel.

4. Then the fourth step I did was to convert all the numbers contained in qr.code.txt into binary numbers using python. Then I put it in notes for validation at the end. <br/> <br/>
```Dec-to-Binary.py``` <br/>
```py
h = open("qr_code.txt", "r")

h = h.read()

for i in h.split():
    binn = bin(int(i))[2:].zfill(29)
    print(binn)
```
After the python code is run, it will produce output as in qr.code.binary.txt

5. After we get the result for the binary number we need. the fifth step is to convert the binary number into an image. That is by turning the number 1 into a black pixel, and the number 0 into a white pixel. <br/> <br/>
```Solve.py``` <br/>
```py
h = open("qr_code.txt", "r")

h = h.read()

size = 0
for i in h.split():
    binn = bin(int(i))[2:]
    size = max(len(binn), size)

for i in h.split():
    binn = bin(int(i))[2:].zfill(29)
    for i in binn:
        print(chr(9608) if i == "1" else " ", end="")
    print()
```
After running the python code. then we will get the results in the form of an image resembling a QR Code. And by using the Snippet tool provided by Windows ```Win + L_Shift + S``` , we can easily take a photo for the QR Code and put the photo on our local computer. <br/> 
But if we try to scan the results we get, the QR Code will not produce results. It can't even be read. This is because, the dimensions of the image generated by the python code are not square results or you could say, the image we just got, is not an equilateral square. Therefore, we must change the dimensions of the image so that it resembles an equilateral square.

6. The sixth step I did was to check the dimensions of the QR Code photo we had taken using Windows Properties. <br/> <br/>
```Image Properties```<br/>
![edit](https://github.com/G34ts/cjv_writeups/assets/126637263/63292047-5585-49f8-8102-9f96040247c9) <br/> <br/>
As we can see. The dimensions of this image are 234 pixels wide and 465 pixels long. The conclusion we can draw is that this image resembles a rectangle in size. So we will dimension this image as [234 pixels x 234 pixels]/[465 pixels x 465 pixels]. I will change the image to [465 pixels x 465 pixels] so that it can be easily viewed. 

7. The seventh step is to use the online tool, <a href="https://www.img2go.com/resize-image" target="_blank">Resize Image Online</a>, we will change the dimensions of the image to [465 pixels x 465 pixels]. <br/> 

8. The last step, after finishing changing the image dimensions and downloading the image to the local computer. we can open the image and scan the QR Code (can use Google Lens on the Smartphone Camera or use Online Tools). After that.... Congratulations We have obtained the Flag for the 1black0white challenge. Good Luck :) <br/> <br/>
